# Infinite Noughts and Crosses

Custom Noughts and Crosses game I created to make the game more strategic and fun.

## Rules

- Every move must be vertically or horizontally adjacent to the last one
- You can sacrifice a turn to extend the board by a row or column in any direction
- Otherwise usual rules apply, 3 in a row wins!
